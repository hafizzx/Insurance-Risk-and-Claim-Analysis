# 📊 Insurance Risk Data Analysis Project  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project analyzes **insurance policyholder data** to uncover insights about customer demographics, claim behavior, and potential risk factors.  
The goal is to help the insurance company make **data-driven decisions** by understanding policy distribution and claim patterns.  

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies  
- **Python (Google Colab)** → Data cleaning, preprocessing, and analysis  
- **Pandas & NumPy** → Data manipulation  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** → Data visualization  
- **Power BI** → Interactive dashboard and business insights  

---

## 📂 Dataset Information  
The dataset includes policyholder and claim details such as:  
- **Demographics** (Age, Gender, Education, Marital Status, Household Income)  
- **Vehicle Information** (Car Make, Model, Year, Use)  
- **Insurance Details** (Coverage Zone, Claim Frequency, Claim Amount, Policy Count)  

---

## 📊 Key Metrics Calculated  
1. **Total Policies** → Measures the size of the active customer base  
2. **Total Claim Amount** → Tracks the overall financial impact of claims  
3. **Claim Frequency** → Analyzes how often claims are being made  
4. **Average Claim Amount** → Assesses claim severity and potential risk exposure  
5. **Gender-wise Total Policies** → Understands customer distribution across genders  

---

## 📈 Visualizations in Python  
Using **Matplotlib**, the following charts were created:  
- Donut Chart → **Car Use** distribution  
- Bar Chart → Policies & Claims by **Car Make**  
- Donut Chart → Policies & Claims by **Coverage Zone**  
- Histogram → **Age Group** distribution of policyholders  
- Area Chart → Policies & Claims by **Car Year**  
- Pie Chart → Distribution by **Education Level**  
- Heatmap → **Education & Marital Status** vs Claims  

---

## 📊 Power BI Dashboard  
The project also includes an **interactive dashboard** in Power BI with:  
- Claim & Policy Filters  
- Dynamic Charts (interlinked)  
- Drill-down by Car Use, Age Group, Car Year, and more  
- Interactive feature: Clicking one chart updates all others  

---

## 🎯 Business Insights  
- Younger drivers (18–25) have higher claim frequency  
- Certain car brands are more claim-prone  
- Urban and highly urban zones show higher claim amounts  
- Education and marital status impact claim behavior  
- Households with kids driving have increased risk  

---

## 🚀 How to Use  
1. Open the Jupyter/Colab notebook → run the code for preprocessing and visualization.  
2. Explore the Power BI dashboard (`.pbix` file) for interactive analysis.  

---

## 📌 Future Improvements  
- Implement **Machine Learning models** for claim prediction  
- Add **real-time Power BI integration**  
- Explore **customer segmentation** using clustering
